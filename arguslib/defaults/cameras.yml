# Config for cameras
# A dictionary of campaign names, each with a dictionary of camera names
# Each camera has a type, position, and rotation (three angles, or one in the
# case of a roll around a vertical optical axis.
# 
# 
# All-sky cameras take a calibration yaml file. `calibration_file` is the path
# to the camera calibration file, if null, the default file will be used
# (arguslib/defaults/cobalt_3-7_calibration.yml).
# 
# Perspective cameras are currently set up to instead take focal lengths and
# principal points only. The focal lengths are in pixels, and can be calculated
# using the helper function arguslib.camera.calibration.focal_length_px.
# 
# Rotation angles are in degrees. They are are measured as:
# 1. The angle measured up from the tangent plane towards the zenith axis
#     (90 = pointing up, 0 = horizontal).
# 2. The azimuth angle, measured clockwise from North (0 = North, 90 = East, etc.)
# 3. The roll angle, measured clockwise when looking along the optical axis
#     in the direction of view. (0 = no roll, positive = clockwise roll). 
# 
# The image axes can also be inverted using the `invert_axes` parameter,
# which takes a list of two booleans [invert_x, invert_y].
