# Config for cameras
# A dictionary of campaign names, each with a dictionary of camera names
# Each camera has a type, position, and rotation (three angles, or one in the
# case of a roll around a vertical optical axis.
# 
# 
# All-sky cameras take a calibration yaml file. `calibration_file` is the path
# to the camera calibration file, if null, the default file will be used
# (arguslib/defaults/cobalt_3-7_calibration.yml).
# 
# Perspective cameras are currently set up to instead take focal lengths and
# principal points only.
