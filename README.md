# Arguslib

Arguslib brings together different observations. It is a Python interface to 
the data record from ground-based cameras, and a tool to visualise their 
intersection with coincident data.

For details and documentation, please see the documentation, which can be found
in the `docs` folder. Examples can be found in the `examples` folder.
